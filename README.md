- **Phishing Domains**: URLs identified as fraudulent, attempting to steal personal information under false pretenses.
- **Scanners and Probers**: IP addresses that scan for open ports and vulnerabilities, often a precursor to more serious attacks.
- **Spam Sources**: Identified sources of bulk unsolicited emails that may contain scams or malware links.
